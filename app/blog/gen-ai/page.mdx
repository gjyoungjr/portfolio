There's been a lot of hype around AI lately, particularly since OpenAI released their GPT model and speculations that the AI race wars might lead to AGI (Artificial General Intelligence). However, with any disruptive product launch, we tend to underestimate its true potential or have a general lack of understanding. Generative AI can be confusing, but in this article, I'll cover everything you need to know:

## What is Generative AI?

I'm pretty sure you've seen the clips of AI Drake dropping bars and wondered how this is possible. Well, that's exactly the power of Generative AI. It's a type of computer intelligence program that can create original content such as text, images, or audio without the need for human input. This is achieved using transformer models which learn by selectively focusing on relevant parts of the input/training data, a process called the attention mechanism. Transformer models were first introduced in the famous paper, [Attention is All You Need](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2017/file/3f5ee243547dee91fbd053c1c4a845aa-Paper.pdf), which was published by a team at Google

## Why should you care about AI?

The pace of AI development is rapidly accelerating, and its impact on our work and daily lives is already significant. With AI assistants, developers and engineers can write higher quality code, while content creators can craft compelling scripts. Given this, it's essential to have a basic understanding of AI's capabilities to leverage these tools effectively for your advantage. This shift is similar to the .com era, where those who lacked computer skills struggled to stay relevant in the workforce. Regrettably, failure to adapt and learn could leave you behind in this rapidly evolving landscape.

## How can I learn to use Generative AI?

As with any technology, the best way to learn is to build. Building real-world projects and implementing AI algorithms to solve them. This provides practical experience and a deeper understanding of how AI works. Identify a real-world problem that you are interested in solving and brainstorm ways to use AI to solve it. Here's a million-dollar idea: how about creating an AI therapist chatbot for engineers to help them de-stress? I mean, we work tirelessly to keep up with the tech race, so why not give us a virtual shoulder to cry on? ðŸ¥²

There are also pre-trained models for tasks like text classification, text to image, text to video available from companies such as

- [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/models) : BERT
- [Amazon](https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/): Amazon Bedrock
- [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/docs/models) : GPT-3 and many other APIs for NLP tasks

Another under appreciated method is to deep-dive into the public research papers about AI. Oftentimes, these papers contain a wealth of information about the development of cutting-edge models and breakthroughs in the field.

## Conclusion

I feel fortunate to be alive in this generation since these are exciting times. As an optimist, I am thrilled to see where AI will take us in the future and hope to be apart of the change as well. While there is some bias against AI, there is truth to the concern that unregulated AI could be harmful. However, I believe that heavily regulating AI could constrain creativity and slow progress.
