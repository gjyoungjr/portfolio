          For the past 3 to 5 years, I've worked in different industries as a
          software engineer, including media, hospitality, and consumer goods.
          However, I've never felt like I'm using my technical skills to truly
          make a difference or improve the world. My curiosity has led me to
          discover a new passion: finding sustainable solutions to address
          climate change and reduce environmental impact. I believe innovation
          in this industry is lacking for a few key reasons

          I believe innovation in this industry is lacking for a few key
          reasons: 1. Government policies and mandates often dictate innovation,
          which can stifle progress. 2. Many believe it's impossible to achieve
          negative or net-zero emissions before 2050, so they don't bother
          trying to solve the problem. Many people don't realize how serious
          climate change is, even if we only achieve a 20% solution or if only a
          few countries cut emissions. To fully solve climate change, we need
          both government regulations and new technology to work together.
          Here's why: - Even if government regulations shift with new political
          parties coming into power, new technology will always remain. -
          Regulations can speed up the use of new technology, which can lower
          costs and make it easier for global deployment - Innovation can drive
          down the cost of technology, leading to its widespread adoption as a
          global requirement. - Cheaper technology can be used all over the
          world, but some regulations can't be applied everywhere (For instance,
          telling a small country in Central America or the Caribbean to halt
          oil exploration isnâ€™t viable, as this activity contributes
          significantly to the country's economic growth.) Reflecting on these
          challenges, I've felt a strong personal drive to take action.
          Experiencing the direct impacts of climate change, especially through
          prolonged heat waves in Belize, has made me bullish about diving into
          climate tech. As a result, I've been actively hacking and researching
          on side projects. Among these, the most promising idea is an AI tool
          that transforms ESG data into actionable insights. The aim is to
          empower individuals and companies to collect and analyze their ESG
          data, enabling data-driven decisions for a cleaner, better future. If
