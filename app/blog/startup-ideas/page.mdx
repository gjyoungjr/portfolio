# I Have the Urge to Build. No Idea What Though

If you've ever felt this, you're not alone. Builders be like; can literally code anything. Also builders, but what tho.

And honestly? With AI, this problem's only gotten worse. Building is the _easy_ part now. You can spin up a full app in minutes. Anything is technically possible, literally. But that just makes the real question even harder: what should you actually build? What's worth your time? That's the part that'll mess with your head.

A reliable way to find something worth building is to pay attention to what repeatedly annoys you in your daily work or life. Persistent friction is often a signal for a real problem worth solving
