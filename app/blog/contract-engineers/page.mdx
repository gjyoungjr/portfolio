# Builders Be Like: Can Literally Code Anything… But What Tho?

If you've ever felt this, you're not alone.

Builders be like: can literally code anything.  
Also builders: …but what tho?

And honestly? With AI, this problem has only gotten worse.

Building used to be the hard part. Now it's the easy part. You can spin up a full app in minutes. Backend, frontend, auth, payments—done. Anything is technically possible. Literally.

And somehow, that makes things harder.

Because when _everything_ is possible, the real question becomes unavoidable: what's actually worth building? What deserves your time, and attention? That's the part that's hard to get clarity on. Not implementation, intention.

## Finding Clarity Through Friction

A reliable way to cut through this is to stop looking for "ideas" and start paying attention to friction.

Notice what repeatedly annoys you in your daily work or life. The small things you workaround. The tools you tolerate. The processes that make you sigh every time you hit them. Persistent friction is rarely random—it's often a signal that a real problem exists, and that it hasn't been solved well yet.

You don't need a world-changing vision to start. You don't need a perfectly articulated startup thesis. You just need to notice the moments where you think, _there has to be a better way_, and take that thought seriously. It doesn't even need to be a startup idea—building for yourself is enough.

The best things to build usually aren't hiding in a brainstorm doc.

They're hiding in the stuff that annoys you every single day.
