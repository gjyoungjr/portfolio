# Contract Engineers: The Underdogs of Tech

There is an ongoing debate about the best hiring strategy in tech. Some argue in favor of offshore contractors, others advocate for full-time employees, and many suggest a blend of both. Despite the varying opinions, software engineer contractors often seem like the underdogs in this debate. Let’s dive deeper into why contractor roles in software engineering are sometimes viewed less favorably and how contractors can turn this perception to their advantage.
Some of my opinions might be biased because I've been a contract engineer for 4+ years.

**Why Contractors Are Often Seen as the Underdogs**

Contractors are typically brought on board with the understanding that their role is temporary and goal-oriented. Imagine your company is experiencing hyper-growth and urgently needs new developers to sustain this scale. In such scenarios, your ideal solution might be to hire a small team of contractors. Here's why:

- Hiring offshore contractors often means lower salaries, saving on costs.
- You don't need to worry about offering 401ks, equity, or any employee benefits.

These pre-defined notions can sometimes lead to contractors feeling undervalued, perceived merely as "code junkies"—engineers who are seen as churning out code without being fully integrated into the team or company culture.

**Turning the Underdog Status into a Superpower**

While the expectations for contractors may be set low, this very notion can be used to their advantage. Here’s how contractors can transform their underdog status into a superpower:

1. **Exceed Expectations:** The common expectation is that as a temporary hire, you’ll only do what’s required to complete the assigned tasks. By consistently going beyond what is expected, you can surprise and impress your team. Whether it’s by delivering higher quality work, suggesting improvements, or finding innovative solutions, exceeding expectations can set you apart.
2. **Take Initiative and Show Leadership:** Don’t just do what you’re told—take initiative. Lead key aspects of your projects, propose new ideas, and drive discussions. By taking on a leadership role, you demonstrate your value and commitment to the project, making yourself indispensable.
3. **Communicate Transparently and Frequently:** Clear and frequent communication is essential. Keep your team updated on your progress, be upfront about any challenges you face, and offer solutions. Transparent communication builds trust and shows that you are engaged and reliable.

By leveraging these strategies, contractors can change the narrative. They can prove that they are not just temporary hires but valuable contributors who bring unique strengths to the table.

**Conclusion**

While software engineer contractors may start off as the underdogs, they have the opportunity to reshape this perception. However, contractors need to keep in mind that staying in a contract role for too long can have its downsides, especially if you're based outside the US. It becomes increasingly challenging as competitive job markets, disqualifications due to ineligibility to work in the US, and the lack of long-term benefits can hold you back. The ideal situation, in my opinion, is to use contracting as a stepping stone—get your foot in the door, gain experience, build your network, and then transition to a full-time staff engineer role. This path allows you to truly embed yourself within a team and continue growing without those barriers. Ultimately, while being a contractor can be rewarding, it's important to recognize when it's time to move on and capitalize on the long-term growth that comes with being a full-time employee.
